    "So we have exactly **64347** women in our dataset, and this is the number we need to protect, since someone could run the same query on a dataset without a single individual, and thus determine their gender (as shown in the [data exploration notebook](./data-exploration.ipynb)). To start, we need to understand what the _sensitivity_ of the query is. Determining this requires knowing your schema and your data, but the general formula is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Delta f = \\max_{D, D'} \\|f(D) - f(D')\\|_{1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\|x\\|_{1}$ is the [L1 norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry) of $x$. Intuitively, this is just the maximum difference in the values that a query $f$ can return on a pair of databases ($D$ and $D'$) that differ in only one row. In our case this means one person is added or removed from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gender count query only returns one value (the count), and this value can only change by a maximum of 1 if we remove or add a person to the database. Therefore, our L1 norm for this query is 1. [Differential privacy theory](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2011/1/103226-a-firm-foundation-for-private-data-analysis/fulltext) tells us that by adding noise drawn from the $Laplace\\left(\\Delta f/\\epsilon\\right)$ distribution, we are guaranteed $\\epsilon$-differential privacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one more thing to consider, which is that running the query multiple times will always reveal a bit more about the distribution (or value, if only a single number is returned) of the underlying data. We therefore need to think about $\\epsilon$ as $\\epsilon_{total}$ instead. So if we run the query $q$ times, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\epsilon_{total} = \\sum^{q}_{i=1}{\\epsilon_i}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We usually refer to $\\epsilon_{total}$ as the _privacy budget_, and each time we run a query, we are using up $\\epsilon_i$ of the budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we consider the case of a single run of the gender count query. Since we know that the _sensitivity_ of this query is $1$, we can use [NumPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/index.html) to generate random noise based on the value of $\\epsilon$ (controlled by the slider)."
