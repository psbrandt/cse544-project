# CSE 544 Final Project
> ### Differential Privacy in the OMOP CDM

## Setup

The experiments are done using [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks. Make sure you add the `postgres` user password as an environment
variable when running `jupyter`:

```
$ PGPASSWORD=s3cr3t jupyter notebook
```

Running `jupyter` from this (the `experiments`) directory probably makes the most sense.
